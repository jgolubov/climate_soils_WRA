# climate_soils_WRA
R code that searches the global biodiversity information facility and crosses the occurrence data with world climate and world soils. As it is implemented for Mexico, the results give back the soils in which the species occurrences are in the polygon representing Mexico. Two things are important to bear in mind. You will need two shapefiles (world soils and world climate) that are included in the repository. You can additionally change the final ouput with you own shapefile to have data in your specific region or polygon.
